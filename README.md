Sqrt 3 Subdivision 

This is a finish of the assignment of Geometry course from ETH Z. 
 
Lots of dependency and complex environment if you are a graphic beginner, then you'd better check their repo  https://github.com/eth-igl
Otherwise, the main libs are Eigen and libigl or just modify the code, use the data type from you lib.
